    <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
        Unqualified, the
        word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports
        commonly
        called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United
        States, and
        sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football
        (specifically
        American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football;
        and rugby
        union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as
        "football
        codes". There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many
        different
        parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these
        games at
        English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion
        and
        cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence
        outside the
        directly controlled empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:
        Gaelic
        football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to
        maintain
        their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional
        football
        associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most
        popular
        team sports in the world.[9]</p>

    <h2 id="Rules">Rules of football
        * A match consists of two 45 minutes halves with a 15 minute rest period in between.
        *Each team can have a minimum off 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to handle
        the ball
        within the 18 yard box) and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match.
        *The field must be made of either artificial or natural grass. The size of pitches is allowed to vary but must
        be within
        100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. The pitch must also be marked with a rectangular shape around the
        outside
        showing out of bounds, two six yard boxes, two 18 yard boxes and a centre circle. A spot for a penalty placed 12
        yards
        out of both goals and centre circle must also be visible.
        *The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape.
        *Each team can name up to 7 substitute players. Substitutions can be made at any time of the match with each
        team being
        able to make a maximum of 3 substitutions per side. In the event of all three substitutes being made and a
        player having
        to leave the field for injury the team will be forced to play without a replacement for that player.
        *Each game must include one referee and two assistant referee’s (linesmen). It’s the job of the referee to act
        as time
        keeper and make any decisions which may need to be made such as fouls, free kicks, throw ins, penalties and
        added on
        time at the end of each half. The referee may consult the assistant referees at any time in the match regarding
        a
        decision. It’s the assistant referee’s job to spot offside’s in the match (see below), throw ins for either team
        and
        also assist the referee in all decision making processes where appropriate.
        * If the game needs to head to extra time as a result of both teams being level in a match then 30 minutes will
        be added
        in the form of two 15 minute halves after the allotted 90 minutes.
        *If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must take place.
        The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
        For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity of the foul;
        this comes
        down to the referee’s discretion. *The yellow is a warning and a red card is a dismissal of that player. Two
        yellow cards
        will equal one red. Once a player is sent off then they cannot be replaced.
        *If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in. If it
        goes out of
        play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. *If it comes off a defending player it is
        a corner
        kick.
        *The Offside Rule in Football
        Offside can be called when an attacking player is in front of the last defender when the pass is played through
        to them.
        *The offside area is designed to discourage players from simply hanging around the opponent’s goal waiting for a
        pass. To
        be onside they must be placed behind the last defender when the ball is played to them. If the player is in
        front of
        that last defender then he is deemed to be offside and free kick to the defending team will be called.

        *A player cannot be caught offside in their own half. The goalkeeper does not count as a defender. If the ball
        is played
        backwardss|diff_marker|>rds to a player then they cannot be offside.

    <h2>Skills and techniques</h2>
    <p> <br>
        First Touch (Ball Control): The ability to receive and control the ball quickly and cleanly, using feet, thighs,
        or
        chest. A good first touch sets up the next move.
        <br>
        ⚽ Offensive Techniques

        Passing: Includes short passes, long passes, and specialized techniques like inside-foot passes, outside-foot
        passes,
        and chip passes. Passing builds team play and maintains possession.
        <br>

        Dribbling: Running with the ball while maintaining control. This can be in tight spaces (close dribbling) or
        open spaces
        (speed dribbling). Skill moves like step-overs or feints help beat defenders.
        <br>

        Shooting: Striking the ball towards goal with accuracy and power. Techniques include volleys, half-volleys, and
        finesse
        shots.
        <br>

        Heading: Using the head to pass, clear, or score goals. Timing and positioning are crucial.
        <br>

        Goalkeeping Skills: Includes shot-stopping, handling crosses, distributing the ball, and techniques like drop
        kicks and
        throw-ins.
        <br>

        🛡️ Defensive Techniques
        Pressing: Applying pressure on opponents to force mistakes or regain possession.

        Marking: Staying close to an opponent to limit their options and deny space.

        Tackling & Interceptions: Winning the ball through clean tackles or anticipating passes to intercept.
        <br>

        🎯 Advanced Techniques
        Chip Crosses & Lobs: Delivering the ball over defenders into dangerous areas.

        Chest Control: Using the chest to control aerial balls before passing or shooting.

        Throw-ins: Executed with both hands behind the head, often used to restart play strategically.
        <br>

        🏃 Training Tips to Improve
        Practice small-sided games to sharpen passing and movement.

        Use cone drills for dribbling and ball control.

        Train shooting accuracy with target zones in goal.

        Work on fitness and agility to support both attacking and defending.

        Goalkeepers should practice reaction drills and distribution under pressure.

        Football is a balance of individual skill and team coordination. Players who master these techniques can adapt
        to
        different positions and styles of play, making them versatile and effective on the pitch.

        <h2>Positions in football</h2>
        <p>🧤 Goalkeeper (GK)
        The only player allowed to use hands within the penalty area.
        
        Primary role: stop shots, organize defense, and distribute the ball.
        
        Requires excellent reflexes, positioning, and communication.
        <br>
        
        🛡️ Defenders
        Center-Backs (CB): Stay central, block shots, win aerial duels, and mark strikers.
        
        Full-Backs (LB/RB): Play wide, defend against wingers, and support attacks with overlapping runs.
        
        Wing-Backs (LWB/RWB): More attacking versions of full-backs, often used in formations with three center-backs.
        
        Sweeper (rare today): Positioned behind center-backs to clear loose balls and cover defensive gaps.
        <br>
        
        ⚙️ Midfielders
        Defensive Midfielder (CDM): Shields the defense, breaks up opposition play, and starts counter-attacks.
        
        Central Midfielder (CM): The “engine” of the team, linking defense and attack with passing and movement.
        
        Attacking Midfielder (CAM): Creates scoring opportunities, assists strikers, and often takes shots from distance.
        
        Wide Midfielders/Wingers (LM/RM): Provide width, deliver crosses, and stretch the opposition defense.
        <br>
        🎯 Forwards
        Striker (ST): Main goal-scorer, positioned closest to the opponent’s goal.
        
        Center Forward (CF): Similar to striker but may drop deeper to link play.
        
        Second Striker (SS): Plays just behind the main striker, combining creativity with finishing.
        
        Wingers (LW/RW): Attack from wide areas, cut inside to shoot, or cross into the box.</p>
